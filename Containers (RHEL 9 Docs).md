This is a summary of the RHEL 9 document [Building, running, and managing containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/building_running_and_managing_containers).

### Chapter 1. Starting with containers

> Unlike other container tools implementations, the tools described here do not center around the monolithic Docker container engine and `docker` command. Instead, Red Hat provides a set of command-line tools that can operate without a container engine.

The tools mentioned are essentially those from the [containers](https://github.com/containers) software suite.
