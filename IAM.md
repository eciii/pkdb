**IAM** stands for **Identity and Access Management** (see the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management)).

**Notable FOSS projects**

- [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org), a software suite promoted and maintained by Red Hat.
- [Open Identity Platform](https://www.openidentityplatform.org/), a software suite composed of components with quite a history:
	- The _Access Management_ and _Directory Services_ components date back to two projects at Sun Microsystems: OpenSSO and OpenDJ. Later, after Oracle's takeover of Sun Microsystems, the projects' source code was closed. In response to that, ForgeRock, a company based in the USA that developed other IAM software, forked those projects and continued their open source development and support. ForgeRock also rebranded OpenSSO as OpenAM.
	- The _Identity Management_ and _Identity Gateway_ components originated directly at ForgeRock and were originally open source projects with the names OpenIDM and OpenIG.
	- ForgeRock closed the source code of all four projects on 2016 and rebranded them into a single product: [Identity Platform](https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform). As a response the _Open Identity Platform_ project was established to continue the open source development of the four projects.
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), a CNCF incubating project sponsored by Red Hat (to the point that the GUI is suspiciously similar to the GUI of Ansible AWX).
- For more open source IAM projects see [here](https://medium.com/@devops.ent/top-identity-and-access-management-systems-iam-open-source-enterprise-92cf66560a55). It seems that all of these projects (or at least the most interesting ones) are written in Java.
