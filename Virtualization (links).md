**Landscape**

A **hypervisor** is a piece of software that is able to _supervise_ the concurrent execution of several OSes. Since an OS _supervises_ the concurrent execution of several processes, a hypervisor can be considered as a supervisor of supervisors, hence the name _hypervisor_.

When an OS runs directly on hardware it runs with full privileges, i.e it can access all the resources provided by the hardware and execute all the instructions
