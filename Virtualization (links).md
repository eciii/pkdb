- Blog post by Paolo Bonzini (maintainer of KVM and Red hat employee): [All you need to know about KVM userspace](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/all-you-need-know-about-kvm-userspace). It mentions the relationship between KVM and "modern" VMMs like Google's crosvm, Amazon's Firecracker and Intel's Clould Hypervisor.

Literature:

- The book _Virtual Machines: Versatile Platforms for Systems and Processes_. A bit outdated (2005) but still a nice reference for virtualization fundamentals when virtualization was "all hype".
- The chapter _Virtualization and the Cloud_ of Tanenbaum's book _Modern Operating Systems_. Also a bit outdated but still with solid fundamentals.
