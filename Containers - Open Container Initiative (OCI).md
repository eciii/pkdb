Some history:

- The OCI is an industry body that was formed inÂ 2015 by Docker and the Linux Foundation. Back then Docker Inc. refactored its software into a number of smaller components and some of those components, along with their specifications, were placed under the care of the OCI.

Overview of the specifications (from LWNs "Docker and the OCI container ecosystem")

> The OCI image specification defines a format for container images that consists of a JSON configuration (containing environment variables, the path to execute, and so on) and a series of tarballs called "layers". The contents of each layer are stacked on top of each other, in series, to construct the root filesystem for the container image.

> The OCI also publishes a distribution specification. \[...] This specification defines an HTTP API for pushing and pulling container images to and from a server; servers that implement this API are called container registries. Docker maintains a large public registry called Docker Hub as well as a reference implementation (called "Distribution", perhaps confusingly) that can be self-hosted. Other implementations of the specification include Red Hat's Quay and VMware's Harbor, as well as hosted offerings from \[cloud and git providers].
