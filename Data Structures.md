**Data structures** (DS) can be divided into two categories: **abstract data structures** (ADS) and **concrete data structures** (CDS).

An ADS is abstract in the sense that it is defined only by its *interface*. A CDS is concrete in the sense that it is defined only by its *implementation*.

It might be possible to implement an ADS using multiple CDSs and it might be possible that a CDS implements multiple ADSs.
