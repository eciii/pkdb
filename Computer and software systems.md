Two types of systems and their related disciplines:

- Computer systems: computer science and computer engineering
- Software systems: software science and software engineering

A **computer system** is an _electronic system_ (a.k.a _hardware_) that enables _general-purpose computing_ by being able to perform several types of _instructions_. The collection of large sequences of such instructions with a specific purpose is what is known as **software**.

Up until now I've tried to understand computer and software systems from a reductionist perspective (see the Wikipedia entry on [Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)). While this has been useful for me, and I think it is absolutely necessary to understand the myriad of components and sub-components that constitute the computer and software systems, it would be nonetheless interesting to also try to understand computer and software systems from two other perspectives:

- A holistic perspective (see the Wikipedia entries on [Systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), [Holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism) and [Transdisciplinarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdisciplinarity)).
- From a "practice" perspective, where memorization and training is intentional (like in medicine).
