A **software product** is one or more pieces of software that are advertised, packaged and distributed as a unit.

An **open-source software project** is a concentrated effort of a group of people, the **project participants**, that **contribute** to the production of one or more related software products.

The nature of the project participants might vary greatly. Examples of project participants are: private companies, public communities, single contributors, foundations, etc.

Similarly the nature of the contributions might vary greatly. Examples of types of contributions are:

- Product-related
  - enhancement of source code (bug fixes, new features, etc)
  - enhancement of documentation
  - enhancement of translations (language additions, translation coverage)
- Publicity-related
  - Marketing, i.e. to promote adoption of the software products
  - Engagement, i.e. to promote contribution to the project
- Administration-related
  - IT Infrastructure
  - Legal support

The "_community_" is healthy if:

- is actively engaged
- It is diverse but united in principles and goals.

A software project can have the following characteristics:

- Its software product:
	- are FOS (Free and Open Source), i.e their source code is open and has a "free" license
	- have ODev (Open Development), i.e their development is made in the open
- It has a HC (Healthy Community)
	- It has CDev (Community Development), i.e the development is made by its HC.
	- It has CGov (Community Governance), i.e the governance represents the interests of its HC.

_Open core_ projects are software projects where:

- A single for-profit enterprise has full trademark rights and administrative power (e.g ownership of the DNS domain). Thus they have no CG.
- There is a _Community Edition_ (CE) and an _Enterprise Edition_ (EE) of the software products:
	- The CE is open source, but the source might or might not have a "free" license.
