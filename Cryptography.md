Crypto libraries:

- libcrypto (from the OpenSSL project)
- libnettle and libhogweed (both from the [Nettle](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/) project).
- [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to) and [libsodium](https://libsodium.org/)

Other interesting crypto projects (while both projects publish their sources none of them is really open source):

- https://www.stunnel.org
- https://www.tarsnap.com and its [open source sub-projects](https://www.tarsnap.com/open-source.html): scrypt, kivaloo and spiped

There is an interesting comparison of spiped and stunnel [here](https://www.tarsnap.com/open-source.html).
