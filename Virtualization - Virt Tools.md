**Virt Tools** is an initiative that aggregates several projects with the aim of providing an integrated virtualization framework on Linux. The projects, although strongly coupled, are independent of each other.

The list of projects can be broadly categorized in two groups:

- A software stack (I'll call it _VirtStack_) that turns Linux into an hypervisor. The stack is composed of three projects:
	- [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/)
	- [QEMU](http://qemu.org/)
	- [libvirt](http://libvirt.org/).
- A suite of supporting tools for VirtStack hypervisors (I'll call it _VirtTools_). These tools are provided by three different projects:
	- [libguestfs](https://libguestfs.org/)
	- [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/)
	- [libosinfo](http://libosinfo.org/).
