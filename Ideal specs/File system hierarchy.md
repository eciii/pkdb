**Random thoughts about an ideal OS**

The kernel gives full privileges to a user called `system`. This user is analogous to the traditional `root` user but with some differences. Logins are not allowed for the `system` user. Also the only process running under this user must be the `init` process (`systemd`?).

All other service processes should run under corresponding users, each of which is given a a specific role (a set of kernel capabilities). For example the NTP client should be run under a user that is given the "timekeeper" role, which itself consists of the kernel capabilites necessary to be able to set the system time.
