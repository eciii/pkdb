**Systems**

Two types of approaches:

- A reductionist perspective (see the Wikipedia entry on [Reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism)).
- A holistic perspective (see the Wikipedia entries on [Systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), [Holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism), [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) and [Transdisciplinarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdisciplinarity)).

**Computer and Software Systems**

Two types of systems and their related disciplines:

- Computer systems -> computer science
- Software systems -> software engineering

- A _computer system_ is a system that can perform _computations_.
- Computations are the building blocks for the processing of information.
- Algorithms are abstract procedures that are implemented using computations.
- Algorithms facilitate the assembly of computations.
- Assemblies of computations are known as _software_.
- _Software systems_ are systems made up of software components.

A **computer system** is an _electronic system_ (a.k.a _hardware_) that makes _general-purpose computing_ possible by being able to perform several types of _instructions_. The collection of large sequences of such instructions, with a specific purpose, is what is known as **software**.

- _Digital world_ in contrast to _physical world_.
- The digital world emerges from the _processing_, _transmission_, and _storage_ of _digital information_ (the _digital information triad_).
- _IT_ is the concept that comprises all the technologies that enable the realization of the digital information triad. An _IT system_ is a concrete implementation of such technologies.
- _IT Infrastructure_ is the concept that comprises the foundational structures and underlying IT systems necessary to sustain higher-level IT systems.
