- Meaning of **to log**: to record an event in a log. A log is a record of events ordered by moment of occurrence.
- Meaning of **to record**: to set down for preservation in permanent form, usually in a record. A record is a piece of information permanently stored for preservation. It is also a collection of related records.
- The difference between a log and a record is that any kind of information can be recorded but only events can be logged (an event is a piece of information that indicates that something happened). A record, as a collection, is not necessarily ordered, whereas a log is always ordered by moment of occurrence.
- Logging is done for multiple purposes:
 - to document the occurrence of an event for potential evidence
  - to register the operational details of a process for debugging in case something goes wrong
  - to calculate metrics and recognize patterns.
