#OSS_Project_Overview

Widget Toolkit based on [[GLib]].

Quick overview facts:

- The project is mainly developed and maintained by the [[GNOME]] project.
- The [source code](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/) is hosted on GNOME's GitLab servers.
- The official website is located at [https://www.gtk.org/]().
- Although the documentation is located under `/docs/` in the official website it seems that there was a previous but still relevant documentation website that had its own dedicated subdomain [https://docs.gtk.org]().
- The blog has its own dedicated subdomain [https://blog.gtk.org/]().

**Python binding**

- Python bindings are provided by [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io).
- The [source code](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject) is hosted on GNOME's GitLab servers.
- The official website offers some guides but they don't seem to be neither polished nor comprehensive.
- There is a [Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial](https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io) that seems to be much more polished and comprehensive. It is even mentioned as a reference in the _Getting Started_ section of the official website. However this tutorial does not cover GTK 4.
- The official website seems to have an API reference under the _User Guide_ section but a separate [PyGObject API Reference](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs) is mentioned in the official website in a sort of official manner.
