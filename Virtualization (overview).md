Some relevant projects are:

**Virt Tools**: \[[Homepage](https://www.virt-tools.org/)]

A collection of projects that provide virtualization capabilities to Linux. The projects, although strongly coupled, are independent of each other. The projects can be broadly categorized in two groups:

- A software stack (I'll call it _VirtStack_) that turns Linux into an hypervisor. The stack is composed of three projects: [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/), [QEMU](http://qemu.org/) and [[libvirt]].
- A suite of supporting tools for VirtStack hypervisors (I'll call it _[[VirtTools]]_). These tools are provided in three different projects: [libguestfs](https://libguestfs.org/), [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) and [libosinfo](http://libosinfo.org/).

**cloud-init**: \[[Homepage](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io)]

A project and a de-facto standard for the initialization of cloud virtual machines.
