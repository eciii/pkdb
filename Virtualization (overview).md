Some relevant projects are:

- [Virt Tools](https://www.virt-tools.org/): A collection of projects that provide virtualization capabilities to Linux. The projects, although strongly coupled, are independent of each other. The projects can be broadly categorized in two groups:
	- A software stack that converts Linux into a hypervisor. The stack is composed of three projects: [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/), [QEMU](http://qemu.org/) and [Libvirt](http://libvirt.org/).
	- A suite of supporting tools for the hypervisor enabled by the above mentioned stack. These tools are provided in three different projects: [libguestfs](https://libguestfs.org/), [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) and [libosinfo](http://libosinfo.org/).
- [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io): A project and a de-facto standard for the initialization of cloud virtual machines.
