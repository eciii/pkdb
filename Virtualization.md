Support for virtualization in Linux can be considered from two different perspectives:

- when the Linux system act as a host (a.k.a _hypervisor_)
- when the Linux system act as a guest (a.k.a _virtual machine_)

### Hypervisor perspective

Hypervisor support in Linux is provided mainly by the [Virt Tools](https://www.virt-tools.org/) stack.

_TODO: see also the latest Red Hat manual on virtualization_
