The [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/) project ([repo](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios)) was started in 2002. It is composed of a core written in C with a PHP/Javascript web interface, both of which are developed in the same git repository. Nagios uses a modular plugin architecture to implement the monitoring checks, however it is distributed without plugins. Instead, a collection of fundamental plugins are developed in a separate project called [Nagios Plugins](http://nagios-plugins.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins)). The project also offers a public plugin directory called [Nagios Exchange](https://exchange.nagios.org/).

Multiple issues with Nagios have led to the creation of some forks:

* [Icinga](https://icinga.com/) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icinga)) is a fork started in 2009. Eventually, with the release of version 2, the software deviated substantially from the original Nagios code base and now it is a project composed of mainly two components: the [Icinga 2](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2) core, written in C++ and the [Icinga Web 2](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2) web interface, written in PHP/Javascript. The project also offers a public plugin directory called [Icinga Exchange](https://exchange.icinga.com/).
* [Naemon](https://www.naemon.org/) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naemon)) is a fork started in 2014. The project focuses on the [naemon-core](https://github.com/naemon/naemon-core) (written in C) while delegating the web interface to a different project called [Thruk](http://thruk.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/sni/Thruk)), an independent "multi-backend monitoring web interface" for Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken. Naemon uses a customized flavor of Livestatus called [naemon-livestatus](https://github.com/naemon/naemon-livestatus) for its communication with Thruk.
* [Shinken](http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinken_(software))) is a backwards-compatible rewrite of Nagios in Phyton.
* [Monitoring Plugins](https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/monitoring-plugins/monitoring-plugins)) is a fork of the Nagios Plugins project started in 2014, following a controversial move by Nagios (see [here](https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/news/new-project-name.html)).

As all these forks appeared, each with multiple components, the installation and initial configuration of such monitoring systems grew considerably in complexity. As a consequence a new project called [Open Monitoring Distribution (OMD)](https://omdistro.org/) emerged. It was a distribution that bundled together many of the components used in a typical Nagios installation. The distribution contained prebuilt binaries and a bunch of make scripts that automated the installation and initial configuration. Additionally, a Python script called `omd` was provided, which streamlined the administration of the distribution after installation. OMD is no longer developed. Instead, two independent versions of OMD emerged:

* [OMD Labs](https://labs.consol.de/omd/) ([repo](https://github.com/ConSol/omd)) developed by ConSol GmbH. It deviates from the original OMD only in the addition of new components like Naemon, Icinga 2, Grafana, Prometheus and LDM among others.
* [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com/) ([repo](https://github.com/tribe29/checkmk), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_MK)) developed by tribe29 GmbH. It is based on OMD (the ''omd'' directory in the root of the repository is the original OMD source code with adjustments) but provides additional software in particular its own web interface. The communication between the Nagios core and the web interface is done through a sort of "middleware interface" called Livestatus. The use of such an interface was an original idea from them, and its implementation has become sort of a de facto standard (e.g it is also used by Thruk).
